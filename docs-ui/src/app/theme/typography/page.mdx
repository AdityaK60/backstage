# Typography

Backstage UI offers a suite of typography components designed to seamlessly align
with the rest of your Backstage instance. While you can customize their
appearance to match your brand, the underlying API remains consistent and
unchanged. Each component is built on a responsive structure, allowing you to
define different typography values for various breakpoints.

## Text

Backstage UI provides four distinct text variants, each offering different font sizes
carefully designed to cover the majority of use cases. These variants are
versatile and can be paired with regular and bold of font weights. You can use
the [Text component](?path=/docs/components-text--docs) to add text to your
page.
